# 06 - Graph Algorithms (DFS & BFS)

This folder contains basic graph traversal problems solved using C++.  
Both **Breadth-First Search (BFS)** and **Depth-First Search (DFS)** are implemented to build a foundation for competitive programming and problem-solving.

## Covered Topics
- Graph representation (adjacency list)
- BFS for shortest path
- DFS for connected components
- 2D grid traversal (maze, cabbage field, chessboard)
- Visited array and queue usage
