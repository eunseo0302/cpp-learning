# 06 - Graph Algorithms (DFS & BFS)

This folder contains implementations of basic graph traversal algorithms using C++:  
- **BFS (Breadth-First Search)** for shortest path and level-wise exploration  
- **DFS (Depth-First Search)** for connected components and recursive exploration  

Each problem is solved using appropriate STL containers like `vector`, `queue`, and tracked with a `visited[]` array.

## Covered Concepts

- Graph representation using adjacency lists or grids
- Traversal in 1D and 2D graphs
- BFS for shortest time/path problems
- DFS for connected components counting
- Input parsing from string to grid
- Sorting connected component sizes
