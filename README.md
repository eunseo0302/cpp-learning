# cpp-learning

This repository contains my C++ learning journey, including basic syntax practice, small projects, template programming, and STL (Standard Template Library) usage.

I am continuously updating this repository as I deepen my understanding of C++.

## Folder Structure

- **01_basic_syntax**  
  Basic syntax exercises such as loops, functions, arrays, and simple class usage.

- **02_projects**  
  Small C++ projects implementing object-oriented programming concepts like inheritance, polymorphism, dynamic memory management, and simple management systems.

- **03_templates**  
  Template-based programming exercises including dynamic arrays with resizing, and template class expansion.

- **04_stl**  
  Practice with STL containers like vector, map, and algorithms such as sort, including small applications like member management and word dictionary.

## Notes

This repository is being continuously updated as I practice and advance my C++ skills.  
Each file is an independent exercise or small project to reinforce specific concepts.
