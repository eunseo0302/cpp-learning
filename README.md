# cpp-learning

This repository contains my C++ learning journey, including basic syntax practice, small projects, template programming, STL (Standard Template Library) usage, and problem-solving exercises.

I am continuously updating this repository as I deepen my understanding of C++ through hands-on projects and concept-based exercises.

## Folder Structure

### 01_basic_syntax  
Basic syntax exercises such as loops, functions, arrays, conditionals, and simple class usage.

### 02_projects  
Small C++ projects implementing object-oriented programming concepts like inheritance, polymorphism, dynamic memory management, and STL-based systems such as an emergency room queue simulator.

**Example files:**
- `animal_clinic.cpp`: Manages patient records using class and pointer basics.  
- `book_management.cpp`: A simple system for managing book information with file I/O.  
- `emergency_simulator.cpp`: Simulates an emergency room queue using `priority_queue` and a custom comparator.

### 03_templates  
Template-based programming exercises including dynamic arrays with resizing, and template class expansion using type-generic designs.

**Example files:**
- `myarray_template.cpp`: Implements a resizable array using templates.  
- `myarray_template_extended.cpp`: Extended version with additional functionality.

### 04_stl  
Practice with STL containers such as `vector`, `map`, `set`, `priority_queue`, and algorithms like `sort`, applied in small applications.

**Example files:**
- `member_management.cpp`: Manages user data using `map`.  
- `word_dictionary.cpp`: A simple word-frequency counter using `unordered_map`.  

### 05_problem_solving  
A collection of small algorithmic problems to reinforce logic, control flow, and STL usage.

**Example files:**
- `01_extract_vowels.cpp`: Extracts vowels from a string.  
- `03_check_palindrome.cpp`: Checks if a string is a palindrome.  
- `04_sum_digits_in_string.cpp`: Sums up all digits found in a given string.

## Notes

- Each file is an independent exercise or small project to reinforce specific C++ concepts.
- This repository is intended to reflect practical learning progress, not just textbook theory.
